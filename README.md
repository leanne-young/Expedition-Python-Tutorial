# Expedition-Python-Tutorial

Expedition Python Tutorial is a fun, brief, educational program I made in Grade 10 to help other kids learn a few basic lines of code. It features short animations, avatar control, and multiple choice questions. To run the game, make sure you have Pygame on your computer.
